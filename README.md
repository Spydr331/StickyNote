# StickyNote

This is a sticky note art prototype made when I was trying to figure out how to decorate a window with sticky notes.  

The controls give the size of the window and the size of the sticky note, in case the default note size is too large for the size of the window being emulated.

There currently are eight options for sticky note color and when clicking on one you can hold the mouse down to color in multiple spots on the board.

After the note is placed a counter appears at the bottom of the page counting how many notes are needed for the particular piece of art.
